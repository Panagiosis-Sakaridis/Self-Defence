# Self-Defence

**Self Defence** is a small video game developed by me (Sakaridis Panagiotis) using the [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) game engine. 
It is a personal project that i started during the recent lockdown in Greece.
You play as an immovable [CPhage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage) trying to defend yourself from ominous geometric shapes.

##### Downloading and installing steps:
* **[Download](https://github.com/Panos-Sakar/Self-Defence/blob/master/Build_Win/Zip/Self%20Defence.exe?raw=true)** the latest version of the game and run it to check it out.
* Simply use the mouse to target and left click to fire a projectile that damages other shapes.
